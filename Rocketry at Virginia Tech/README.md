# Rocketry at Virginia Tech is a team that I started during my freshman year at Virginia Tech. This team is student design team that competes in the Spaceport America Cup which is the largest intercollegiate rocketry competion in the world. The team focuses on building rockets that can fly up to 50,000 feet using solid, hybrid, and liquid propulsion systems. 

# Below are names of programs which I wrote while I was a memeber of the team. 

# "CdAvsCdRSolver.m" is a code written in MATLAB. This program was written for the Rocketry at Virginia Tech Team in order to solve for the drag coefficients of a high power rocket with a drag control system.

# "CdAvsCdROutput.pdf" is the output produced by "CdAvsCdRSolver.m"

# "TrajectTimeBased.m" is a MATLAB function writtern for the Rocketry at Virginia Tech Team. The function determines a rocket's trajectory over time intervals. 

# "CompositeAnalysis.m" is MATLAB program written originally for a Composite Material Analysis Course. Now the program is utilized to analyze composite fins on board the rocket. The program accepts inputs from the user to determine the mechanical behvior of a composite material. 

# "43 Project Report.pdf" is an example of the final technical documentation published for the 2019 competiton.
